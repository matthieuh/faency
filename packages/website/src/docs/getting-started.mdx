### Installing Faency

Faency is currently under heavy development, but can be installed by running either of these commands:

```
npm install @containous/faency
```

<br />
or

```
yarn add @containous/faency
```

### Faency Provider

Make sure to wrap your app in the Faency `Provider` to get the default theme:

```js
import { Provider as FaencyProvider } from '@containous/faency'

const App = () => <FaencyProvider>Hey thereðŸ‘‹</FaencyProvider>
```

### Importing components from Faency

All components can be imported directly:

```js
import { Heading, Text, Link } from '@containous/faency'
```
